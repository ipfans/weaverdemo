# weaverdemo

**Last Updated: 2023-06-28**

Based on [`serviceweaver`](https://serviceweaver.dev/) `v0.16.1`. It may not work with other newer versions.

## Hightlight

1. The app name is used the name of package. It seems that the app name is not changable. If it can be changed, please let me know.
2. `weaver single dashboard` will list all processes. It will be indentified by the deployment uuid.
3. `weaver ssh` seems not avaliable. It may happen soon, only some functions are not implemented. `weaver kube` seems to be next step. Skip `serviceweaver` if you need those deployers.
